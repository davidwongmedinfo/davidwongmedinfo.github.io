                    I am <strong>David (Dawei) Wong</strong>, a researcher and engineer in medical bioinformatics. 
					With a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Medicine, I am concurrently pursuing a second Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science while actively engaged in my professional endeavors.  
					<br>
					<br>
					Determined to delve deeply into the medical field with unwavering commitment, my undergraduate years were marked by a unique and unforgettable full-time clinical internship that has profoundly inspired me ever since, solidifying my dedication to this field and promising to continue on this path.
					During my Master's studies, I gained valuable experience in transcriptome analysis, single-cell analysis and biomedical modeling, which has significantly enriched my research capabilities.
					As I embark on my second Bachelor's program, I am endeavoring to expand my research scope to medical AI, particularly focusing on deep learning-driven anti-tumor drug design.  
					<br>
					<br>
					My research interests encompass: (a) Developing tumor markers and risk prediction models based on multi-omics analysis; (b) Applying deep learning in healthcare big data, such as AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment.  
					Furthermore, I find it exhilarating to explore new research areas and am always receptive to new challenges.
					With my interdisciplinary educational backgrounds, I aspire to contribute groundbreaking research that harnesses cutting-edge informatics technology to address complex diseases like cancer, thereby advancing personalized, precision medicine.  
					 <br>
					 <br>
                    Beyond my specialized studies, I maintain a broad range of passions spanning physics, electronic engineering and 3D modeling and animation (please explore them in the 'Gallery' section if they you are interested). I have been continuously dedicating my free time to deepening my understanding and refining my skills within these fascinating domains. 
                     <br>
