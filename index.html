                    I am <strong>David (Dawei) Wong</strong>, a researcher and engineer in medical bioinformatics. 
                    With a Bachelor's degree in Medicine, I am actively engaged in my professional endeavors while concurrently pursuing a second Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.  					
					<br>
					<br>
					Determined to delve deeply into medicine with unwavering commitment, my undergraduate years were marked by a unique and unforgettable full-time clinical internship, which has profoundly inspired me ever since, solidifying my dedication to this field and giving me the resolve to continue on this path.
					During my subsequent research, supervised by <a href="https://sbms.bjmu.edu.cn/jsdw/bssds/Yanhui_Yin.html">Prof. Yanhui Yin</a> and <a href="https://sbms.bjmu.edu.cn/jsdw/bssds/Yuan_Zhou.html">Assoc. Prof. Yuan Zhou</a>, I gained valuable experience in transcriptome analysis, single-cell analysis and biomedical modeling, which has significantly enriched my research capabilities.
					As I embark on my second Bachelor's program, I am endeavoring to expand my research scope to medical AI, particularly focusing on deep learning-driven anti-tumor drug design.  
					<br>
					<br>
					My research interests encompass: (a) AI, particularly deep learning, and its applications in basic and clinical medicine; (b) multi-omics data integration and mining; (c) bioinformatics algorithm development.
					Furthermore, I find it exhilarating to explore new research areas and am always receptive to new challenges.
					With my interdisciplinary background, I aspire to contribute groundbreaking research that harnesses cutting-edge informatics technology to address complex diseases like cancer, thereby advancing personalized, precision medicine.  
					 <br>
					 <br>
                    Beyond my specialized studies, I maintain a broad range of passions spanning physics, electronic engineering and 3D modeling and animation (please explore them in the 'Gallery' section if they you are interested). I have been continuously dedicating my free time to deepening my understanding and refining my skills within these fascinating domains. 
                     <br>
